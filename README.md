‚ú® Features
----------

-   **Sophisticated Question Decomposition:** Powered by **LangGraph**, Chitragupt can break down complex multi-part questions into simpler atomic sub-questions. For example: *"Which store was most profitable, and what was its best-selling product?"*

-   **Interactive Chat UI:** An intuitive, chat-based interface built with **Streamlit** lets you engage with your data effortlessly.

-   **Analyze Any CSV:** Upload any tabular dataset and start querying instantly. The app is completely data-agnostic.

-   **Natural Language Answers:** Chitragupt queries your data using **Pandas** in the background and synthesizes the findings into clear, human-friendly responses.

-   **Transparent Reasoning:** See every sub-question and corresponding answer to understand the AI's thought process step-by-step.

-   **Dynamic Model Selection:** Choose between different **Google Gemini** models (`gemini-1.5-pro`, `gemini-1.5-flash`, etc.) for faster responses or deeper analysis.

-   **Stateful Sessions:** The app remembers your conversation until you upload a new file, at which point it resets for a fresh analysis session.

üß† How It Works: The Recursive Engine
-------------------------------------

```
[Start: User asks a question]
              ‚Üì
[Complexity Node: Atomic or Complex?]
       ‚Üô            ‚Üò
 [Decomposition]    [Resolver Node]
       ‚Üì                   ‚Üë
[Resolver Node] ‚Üê-----------|
       ‚Üì
   [Aggregator Node]
       ‚Üì
      [End]

```

### Node Functions:

| Node | Function |
| --- | --- |
| **Complexity Node** | Uses Gemini to classify if the question is simple (Atomic) or complex. |
| **Decomposition Node** | Breaks complex queries into a sequence of atomic sub-questions. |
| **Resolver Node** | Uses **Pandas** to answer atomic questions by executing code. |
| **Aggregator Node** | Synthesizes multiple answers into a coherent final answer for the user. |
| **Memoization Cache** | Caches answers to speed up repeated queries. |
